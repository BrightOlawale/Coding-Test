## Coding Test

This repository contains the code for the coding test. The codes are written in C. In Code-test-1, we implemented a a function that returns fibonacci sequence based on the following arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and conditions, the fibonacci sequence is calculated using Dynamic Programming. In Code-test-2, we implemented the  piecewise recurrence `F(n) = F(n-3) + F(n -2) where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(2) = 2` relation in the 3 different ways which are: recursive, dynamic programming, and dynamic programming with memoization.
